# ARIA — Project Instructions

## What this is
Local-first Windows AI assistant. Electron UI + Python sidecar brain.
Read BUILD_SPEC.md for the full architecture. Implement ONE PHASE per session.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Electron + Vite dev server (auto-spawns sidecar)
- `npm run sidecar` — Python sidecar alone on :8765
- `npm run build` — production bundle
- `pytest sidecar/tests -v` — Python tests
- `npm test` — renderer tests
- `ruff check sidecar && mypy sidecar` — lint/typecheck Python

## Non-negotiable rules
1. ALL state lives in the Python sidecar. The renderer is a pure view.
   Never store conversation, memory, or task state in React or Electron main.
2. Never load a second model onto the GPU. 6GB VRAM ceiling.
   STT, embeddings, wake word, router → CPU only.
3. Never add `torch` as a dependency. It breaks PyInstaller packaging.
4. Every tool goes through the registry in sidecar/tools/registry.py with an
   explicit permission tier. No ad-hoc subprocess calls outside a tool.
5. Every destructive operation (delete, overwrite, send, purchase, post)
   requires tier T2+ and a user confirmation round-trip. No exceptions.
6. All tool calls are logged to the tool_log table with args and result.
7. Python: full type hints, pydantic models for all boundaries, async by default.
8. TypeScript: strict mode, no `any`.
9. Structured logging via structlog. Never print().
10. Do not refactor prior phases unless the current phase says to.

## Style
- Prefer explicit over clever. This code will be debugged at 2am.
- Small functions. If it exceeds ~50 lines, split it.
- Error messages must say what to do next, not just what failed.

## Current phase
Phase 0 complete (acceptance gate passed). Next: Phase 1 — Conversation.
Update this line when a phase's acceptance gate passes.

## Provider strategy (decided 2026-08-06, supersedes BUILD_SPEC §4/§9.7)
Cloud is **OpenAI and Gemini via API keys**, not Anthropic. Ollama is the
offline/no-key fallback, not merely the "cheap" path.
- `providers/` gets one module per cloud vendor behind a shared interface;
  `core/router.py` picks a *provider*, not just local-vs-cloud.
- Design the Phase 1 Ollama client against that interface from the start.
  Rule 10 forbids refactoring it later, so the seam has to be right now.
- Keys go in Windows Credential Manager via `keyring` (§11), never `.env`.
  `keyring`, `openai`, `google-genai` are all absent from §4 — add them in the
  phase that needs them. All three are pure HTTP clients, so §2.3's torch-free
  constraint is safe.
- Route indicator in the UI must name the provider, not just "cloud".

## Local model (decided 2026-08-06)
`qwen3.5:4b` for now; `qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M` once pulled. Note `qwen3.5:9b`
is 6.6 GB and CANNOT stay resident on this 6 GB card — do not use it.

**Always send `"think": false` to Ollama.** qwen3.5 is a reasoning model: it
streams into `message.thinking` and leaves `message.content` empty until
reasoning ends. Measured with reasoning on, it produced *zero* content tokens in
200 tokens / ~6s. Consequences:
- Phase 1: read `message.content`, never `thinking`.
- Phase 2: the TTS sentence buffer must key off `content`. Never speak thinking.

## Hardware-measured constraints (RTX 4050, 6 GB, qwen3.5:4b, think=false)
Measured, not assumed. Do not re-derive these; do not design against §10's
estimates where they conflict.

| prompt tokens | first content token |
|---|---|
| 20 | 491 ms |
| 500 | 807 ms |
| 1000 | 1102 ms |
| 2000 | 1453 ms |

Prefill costs **~480ms per 1000 tokens** here — over 3× §10's assumed 150ms.

**So §8.2's 2000-token pre-conversation budget cannot coexist with a <700ms
first token on this machine.** Two mitigations, both required:
1. **Order the prompt stable-first**, against §8.2's stated order. Ollama reuses
   the KV cache for an unchanged prefix: a stable ~1500-token prefix costs
   1970ms once then ~790ms/turn, while putting volatile content early costs
   ~1750ms *every* turn. Put identity/voice/boundaries and tool schemas first;
   affect, temporal context, retrieved facts and episodes last, nearest the
   conversation. §8.2 currently places affect at position 2, which busts the
   cache for everything after it.
2. Keep the real pre-conversation budget nearer 400–800 tokens than 2000.

Phase 1 is unaffected — its prompt is just identity + recent turns. This bites
in Phase 3 (tool schemas) and Phase 5 (retrieval).

## Phase 0 notes for later phases
- Python is **3.11** in `.venv`. `sidecar.ts` resolves it via `ARIA_PYTHON` env,
  then `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`, then bare `python`.
- `requirements.txt` grows one phase at a time; the deferred BUILD_SPEC §4 pins
  are listed in a comment block there with the phase that introduces each.
- Auth token flows Electron → sidecar via `ARIA_TOKEN` (not sidecar → file →
  Electron as §7.1 describes) to avoid a stale-token race on restart. The
  sidecar still writes `data/.handshake` for standalone runs.
- `system.health` returns every §9.6 field; unprobed ones are `null` and named
  in `pending_probes`. Fill in your phase's probe, don't change the shape.
- Two log files: `sidecar.log` is structlog JSON from inside Python;
  `sidecar.out.log` is the child's raw stdout/stderr captured by Electron.
- New JSON-RPC methods: register with `@method("name")` in `rpc/handlers.py`.
  Unregistered methods return -32601 rather than a stub.

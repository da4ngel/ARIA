# ARIA — Project Instructions

## What this is
Local-first Windows AI assistant. Electron UI + Python sidecar brain.
Read BUILD_SPEC.md for the full architecture. Implement ONE PHASE per session.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Electron + Vite dev server (auto-spawns sidecar)
- `npm run sidecar` — Python sidecar alone on :8765
- `npm run build` — production bundle
- `pytest sidecar/tests -v` — Python tests
- `npm test` — renderer tests
- `ruff check sidecar && mypy sidecar` — lint/typecheck Python

## Non-negotiable rules
1. ALL state lives in the Python sidecar. The renderer is a pure view.
   Never store conversation, memory, or task state in React or Electron main.
2. Never load a second model onto the GPU. 6GB VRAM ceiling.
   STT, embeddings, wake word, router → CPU only.
3. Never add `torch` as a dependency. It breaks PyInstaller packaging.
4. Every tool goes through the registry in sidecar/tools/registry.py with an
   explicit permission tier. No ad-hoc subprocess calls outside a tool.
5. Every destructive operation (delete, overwrite, send, purchase, post)
   requires tier T2+ and a user confirmation round-trip. No exceptions.
6. All tool calls are logged to the tool_log table with args and result.
7. Python: full type hints, pydantic models for all boundaries, async by default.
8. TypeScript: strict mode, no `any`.
9. Structured logging via structlog. Never print().
10. Do not refactor prior phases unless the current phase says to.

## Style
- Prefer explicit over clever. This code will be debugged at 2am.
- Small functions. If it exceeds ~50 lines, split it.
- Error messages must say what to do next, not just what failed.

## Current phase
Phase 0 complete (acceptance gate passed). Next: Phase 1 — Conversation.
Update this line when a phase's acceptance gate passes.

## Phase 0 notes for later phases
- Python is **3.11** in `.venv`. `sidecar.ts` resolves it via `ARIA_PYTHON` env,
  then `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`, then bare `python`.
- `requirements.txt` grows one phase at a time; the deferred BUILD_SPEC §4 pins
  are listed in a comment block there with the phase that introduces each.
- Auth token flows Electron → sidecar via `ARIA_TOKEN` (not sidecar → file →
  Electron as §7.1 describes) to avoid a stale-token race on restart. The
  sidecar still writes `data/.handshake` for standalone runs.
- `system.health` returns every §9.6 field; unprobed ones are `null` and named
  in `pending_probes`. Fill in your phase's probe, don't change the shape.
- Two log files: `sidecar.log` is structlog JSON from inside Python;
  `sidecar.out.log` is the child's raw stdout/stderr captured by Electron.
- New JSON-RPC methods: register with `@method("name")` in `rpc/handlers.py`.
  Unregistered methods return -32601 rather than a stub.
